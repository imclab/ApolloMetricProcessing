Apollo Metric Processing

These are scripts for the processing of large
Apollo Metric imagery data sets for bundle adjustment
and stereo correlation.

There are two types of scripts here:

Pythonscripts: Which do most of the work.

PBSscripts: Which call the python scripts and allow
for submission to the super computer. (specifically
and only Pleiades)

NOTE: I'm expecting python 2.6. If you are pleiades
be sure to module load python/2.6.1.
